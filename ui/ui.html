      This file is just a template.
      You can add metatags or add custom fonts here.

      !!--!!
      Note that adding local files here (for example a css file from a folder where this file is) 
      won't work because only this html file is loaded when figma plugin runs.
      !!--!!

      Scripts will be added here during build step.
